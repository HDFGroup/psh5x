SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Explains how familiar HDF5 concepts relate to PowerShell items and
    properties 

LONG DESCRIPTION
    At the heart of the PSH5X module sits a so-called PowerShell provider.
    Through provider cmdlets, PowerShell providers present a set of consistent
    interfaces to custom data stores. Such data stores (e.g., HDF5 files) are
    presented to the user as PowerShell drives (PSDrive). Very much like
    HDF5 path names, PowerShell paths are used to locate PowerShell items
    in a provider. PowerShell items come in two flavors: container items
    and leaf-node (non-container) items. A PowerShell item might have content.
    A PowerShell item might also be decorated with PowerShell item properties.
    The collection of such properties of a PowerShell item can be thought of
    as a hash table (key/value pairs) associated with the item.

    For a quick listing of generic (i.e., not every provider necessarily 
    implements all of them) provider cmdlets type 'help *-Item*' and
    'help *-Content' in a PowerShell session. You'll see names such as
    'New-Item' and 'Move-ItemProperty', names that are suggestive
    of the cmdlet's purpose.

    Finding appropriate HDF5 matches for these PowerShell concepts is
    pretty straightforward. This is our concise PowerShell/HDF5 dictionary:

    PowerShell         HDF5
    ----------         ----

    Drive              File

    Item               Object or Link

    Container Item     Group 

    Leaf Node Item     Dataset, Committed Datatype, or Link

    ItemProperty       Attribute
    
    Content            Dataset Value
    
    Anything in HDF5 that's not an attribute, content, or file is
    an item. Every HDF5 object is an item and HDF5 links are also
    considered items. HDF5 groups are the only kind of container item.
