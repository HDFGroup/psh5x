Instructions for the Installation of the HDF5 PowerShell Module
===============================================================

=================
Before you start:
=================

Make sure that:

1. You have PowerShell version 2 (or later)
-------------------------------------------

PowerShell version 1 is not supported.
Run '$Host.Version' in a PowerShell window to confirm!

2. PowerShell runs with .NET version 4 (or later)
-------------------------------------------------

By default, PowerShell v2 runs with .NET 2. The easiest remedy
is to copy the files powershell.exe.config and powershell_ise.exe.config,
which are included in the module archive, into the $PSHOME directory.
(Typically, this is C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0)

3. The script execution policy is at an appropriate level
---------------------------------------------------------

The script execution policy may be controlled by your administrator.
You can adjust it in the scope of a session (Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process ...).
If you have administrative privileges, you might consider adjusting it
via Set-ExecutionPolicy. The 'Remote-Signed' level is usually sufficient.
See 'help about_Execution_Policies' for more details on script execution policy.

4. The HDF5 1.8.9 DLLs are in your path  
---------------------------------------

The HDF5 binaries are included in the module archive in the Win[32,64]\HDF5
subdirectories. The HDF5 module will fail to load if one or more of the DLLs
cannot be found. The module will also fail to load if a different version of
the HDF5 binaries is found in the path. PSH5X.dll depends on:

    hdf5dll.dll
    hdf5_hldll.dll
    msvcp100.dll
    szip.dll
    zlib.dll

========
To build:
========

To build PSH5X.dll from source you need the HDF5 1.8.9 headers and libraries
included in the Win[32,64]\HDF5 subdirectories of the module archive.
Load the Visual Studio 2010 solution file PSH5X.sln and select
Build -> Build Solution (or Ctrl+Shift+B).

============
To run tests:
============

The tests are distributed with the PSHX source code. Run all tests
by executing Test-ScripHarness.ps1 from the 'test' subdirectory.

==========
To install:
==========

Run Install-PSH5X.ps1 and enjoy HDF5 + PowerShell!
