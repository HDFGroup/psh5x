        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <h3>L1.01 PSH5X treats <tt>/</tt> and <tt>\</tt> as equivalent path separators. Don't even
            think about using them in link names!</h3>
        <p>Apart from the <tt>.</tt> (dot) character, only the <tt>/</tt> (slash) character enjoys a
            special status in HDF5 path names as the path separator. As a result, link names must
            not contain slashes. PSH5X treats forward slashes (<tt>/</tt>) <u>and</u> backslashes
                (<tt>\</tt>) as equivalent path separators. Hence, in PSH5X, a link name must not
            contain either. (There's no such restriction for HDF5 attribute names.)</p>
        <p>In PSH5X, the following drive-qualified path names are equivalent:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><tt>'h5:/What/ a /nice/ path'</tt></li>
            <li><tt>'h5:\What\ a \nice\ path'</tt></li>
            <li><tt>'h5:/What\ a /nice\ path'</tt></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Known Issues</h2>
        <h3>KI1.01 The <tt>-Recurse</tt> parameter in the <tt>Remove-Item</tt> cmdlet does not work
            properly.</h3>
        <h4>Short Answer:</h4>
        <p> This is a known bug in PowerShell 2.0 </p>
        <h4>Long Answer:</h4>
        <p> Let's take a look at the implementated behavior of <tt>Remove-Item</tt>. It expects a
            drive-qualified path and accepts two switches, <tt>-Recurse</tt> and <tt>-Force</tt>.
            The <tt>-Recurse</tt> switch has an effect (recursive deletion) only for HDF5 groups.
            The <tt>-Force</tt> switch tells <tt>Remove-Item</tt> to delete ALL links leading to the
            HDF5 object specified in the path name and has no effect if the path refers to a
            symbolic link. </p>
        <p>To be specific, let's look at an example. Below, the (multi-)graph structure of an HDF5
            file is shown. The file contains four datasets, two groups, a committed datatype, and a
            soft link.</p>
        <img src="sample.gif" alt="PSH5X logo" align="middle" />
        <p> The HDF5 path name space consists of the following paths.</p>
        <pre class="code">
/dset1
/dset2
/dset3
/group1
/group1/dset3
/group2
/group2/dset3
/slink1
/type1
        </pre>
        <p> Assume that we've created an HDF5 drive backed by this file and that the root group is
            our "working directory". We can describe the effect of different invocations of the
                <tt>Remove-Item</tt> cmdlet by showing the change with respect to the original HDF5
            path name space.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><tt>Remove-Item slink1</tt>
                <pre class="code">    
/dset1
/dset2
/dset3
/group1
/group1/dset3
/group2
/group2/dset3
/type1
        </pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                <tt>Remove-Item group2</tt>
                <pre class="code"> 
# we are just deleting the hard link 'group2'
            
/dset1
/dset2
/dset3
/group1
/group1/dset3
/slink1
/type1
        </pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                <tt>Remove-Item group2 -Recurse</tt>
                <pre class="code">
/dset1
/dset2
/dset3
/group1
/slink1
/type1
        </pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                <tt>Remove-Item group2 -Force</tt>
                <pre class="code">
# since group1 links to the same object it gets deleted as well with -Force

/dset1
/dset2
/dset3
/slink1
/type1
        </pre>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p> The PowerShell bug shows for case numbers 2 and 4. You'll be prompted as follows: </p>
        <pre>
PS:24 >remove-item .\group2

Confirm
The item at h5:\group2 has children and the Recurse parameter was not
specified. If you continue, all children will be removed with the item. Are you sure you want to continue?

        <p>This sounds pretty scary, but, in the case of an HDF5 group, doesn't make a lot of sense.
            All we are doing is delete one (2.) or all (4.) links that lead to an HDF5 group. In
            other words, all path names containing these link names will become unavailable. Without
            recursion, we don't touch the (link) members of that group and alternative paths
            bypassing the referenced group remain available.</p>
