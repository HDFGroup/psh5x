        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <h3>1.01 Where do I get help?</h3>
        <p>In PowerShell, the <tt>Get-Help</tt> cmdlet is your one-stop shop for help about cmdlets
            and topics. All PSH5X cmdlets come with some form of help. For example, to get help on
                <tt>New-H5Drive</tt> type <tt>help New-H5Drive</tt> or <tt>New-H5Drive -?</tt>. You
            can get a list of HDF5 related topics by typing <tt>help about_H5*</tt> .</p>
        <h3>1.02 What's the difference between between scripting languages and shell languages?</h3>
        <p>I keep returning to this question about every 3 months and an answer still eludes me. The
            following comment by <a href="http://manning.com/payette2/">Bruce Payette</a> has been a
            steady source of consolation (Windows PowerShell in Action, 2nd Edition, Manning 2011,
            page 7):</p>
        <q>In the end, there's no hard-and-fast distinction between a shell language and a scripting
            language. Some of the features that make a good scripting language result in a poor
            shell user experience. Conversely, some of the features that make for a good interactive
            shell experience can interfere with scripting. Because PowerShell's goal is to be both a
            good scripting language and a good interactive shell, balancing the tradeoffs between
            user experience and scripting authoring was one of the major language design
            challenges.</q>
        <h3>1.03 What datatypes are supported?</h3>
        <p>The ultimate goal is to support all datatypes. When we say 'support', we mean that data
            of that type can be represented in memory and on disk, and be read an written. The
            flexible JSON notation for HDF5 datatypes (see <tt>help about_H5Datatypes</tt>) lets one
            create HDF5 datasets, linked datatypes, and attributes of any HDF5 datatype. However,
            not all of them can be currently read or written. The process to get to a more complete
            support will be very much demand-driven. </p>
        <p>The table below gives an overview of what's supported in the current version.</p>

        <p>Assume that we have a 5553 (rows) by 86 (colums) twodimensional dataset of floating point
            numbers at <tt>h5:/my/floats</tt> that we would like to load into Excel. There's a
            simple four step process to get this done.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create an Excel COM object</li>
            <li>Add a blank workbook and select the target range</li>

        <h3>2.02 Can I use ILNumerics in PowerShell?</h3>
        <p><b>Short answer:</b> Yes.</p>
        <p><b>Long answer:</b>
            <a href="http://ilnumerics.net/">ILNumerics</a> is a high performance math library for
            applications. Use the <tt>Add-Type</tt> cmdlet to load the ILNumerics assembly. You can
            then create ILNumerics .NET objects by casting or with the <tt>New-Object</tt>
            cmdlet.</p>
        <p>Use a package, such as <a href="http://pstx.codeplex.com/">PowerShell Type
                Accelerators</a> to make to code a littler easier to read and type.</p>
        <pre class="code">
Add-Type -Path E:\ILNumerics\ILNumerics_2.11.4464.29952\bin64\ILNumerics64.dll

Import-Module TypeAccelerator

Add-TypeAccelerator ilm   ILNumerics.ILMath

Add-TypeAccelerator ilf32 ILNumerics.ILArray[single]

# convert the value of an HDF5 dataset into an ILNumerics.ILArray&lt;Single&gt;

$il = [ilf32] (Get-H5DatasetValue 'aura:\HDFEOS\SWATHS\HIRDLS\Data Fields\Temperature')

# get the last column

$il[':;end']
        </pre>
        <p> The same is pretty much true for any .NET library. If such a library depends on HDF5,
            e.g., <a href="http://www.hdf5.net/">HDF5DotNet</a>, make sure that it was built against
            the same version of the HDF5 library as PSH5X. </p>
        <h2>Common HDF5 Tasks</h2>
        <h3>3.01 How do I save an XML file in HDF5?</h3>
        <p>There are several different ways of accomplishing that. Most are a variation on the
            following theme: Let's store the <tt>types.ps1xml</tt> file in a scalar string attribute
            of the HDF5 root group. We can store it as a variable-length or fixed-length string. By
            default, attributes are stored in compact form where their size must not exceed 64K. By
            comparision, a scalar dataset is not subject to that restriction.</p>
        <pre class="code">
$x = [string] (Get-Content "$($PSHOME)\types.ps1xml")

# variable-length, UTF-8 encoded string

New-H5Attribute h5tmp:\ vlen_str $x ustring

# in dense storage (default) the attribute size must not exceed 64K

$y = $x.Substring(0,64000)

New-H5Attribute h5tmp:\ fixed_str $y "ustring$($y.Length)"

New-H5Dataset h5tmp:\fixed_str "ustring$($x.Length)" -Scalar

Set-H5datasetValue h5tmp:\fixed_str $x            
        </pre>
        <p> Attributes can be larger than 64K if an object's attribute storage is dense. This
            property must be set at file/object creation time. </p>
        <h3>3.02 How do I save a binary file in HDF5?</h3>
        <p>There are several different ways of accomplishing that. Most are a variation on the
            following theme: Let's store the <a
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad_(software)">Notepad</a> executable,
                <tt>notepad.exe</tt> in a scalar (singleton) HDF5 dataset of an HDF5 opaque type. </p>
        <pre class="code">
# get the file bytes
[byte[]] $x = Get-Content -Encoding byte -Path "$($env:windir)\System32\notepad.exe" -ReadCount 0

# create a scalar HDF5 dataset of an opaque type of the right size (193536 in Windows 7 64-bit)
New-H5Dataset h5tmp:\notepad.exe "opaque$($x.Count)['notepad.exe']" -Scalar

# pump the bytes in
Set-H5DatasetValue h5tmp:\notepad.exe (,$x)
        </pre>
        <p>The <tt>(,$x)</tt> on the last line is not a typo. <tt>Set-H5DatasetValue</tt> compares
            the size of the dataset with the value supplied. Since we are dealing with a scalar
            dataset, <tt>Set-H5DatasetValue</tt> expects a single value. Supplying <tt>$x</tt> as
            the value would create a size mismatch error, since it's an array of length greater than
            one. We must us the comma operator to turn it into a single element array whose only
            element is an array itself.</p>
