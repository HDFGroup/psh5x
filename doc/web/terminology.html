        <h2>Terminology</h2>
        <p> At the heart of the PSH5X module sits a so-called PowerShell provider. Through provider
            cmdlets, PowerShell providers present a set of consistent interfaces to custom data
            stores. Such data stores (e.g., HDF5 files) are presented to the user as PowerShell
            drives (PSDrive). Very much like HDF5 path names, PowerShell paths are used to locate
            PowerShell items in a provider. PowerShell items come in two flavors: container items
            and leaf-node (non-container) items. A PowerShell item might have content. A PowerShell
            item might also be decorated with PowerShell item properties. The collection of such
            properties of a PowerShell item can be thought of as a hash table (key/value pairs)
            associated with the item. </p>
        <p> For a quick listing of generic (i.e., not every provider necessarily implements all of
            them) provider cmdlets type <tt>help *-Item*</tt> and <tt>help *-Content</tt> in a
            PowerShell session. You'll see names such as <tt>New-Item</tt> and
                <tt>Move-ItemProperty</tt>, names that are suggestive of the cmdlet's purpose. </p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>PowerShell</th>
                    <th>HDF5</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td class="leftcol">Drive</td>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Container Item</td>
                    <td>Group</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Leaf Node Item</td>
                    <td>Dataset, Committed Datatype, or Link</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Item Property</td>
                    <td>Attribute</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Content</td>
                    <td>Dataset Value</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>Anything in HDF5 that's not an attribute, content, or file is an item. Every HDF5 object
            is an item and HDF5 links are also considered items. HDF5 groups are the only kind of
            container item.</p>
