        <h3>Using the HDF5 Core Virtual File Driver (VFD)</h3>
        <p> By default PSH5X creates and opens files with the <tt>H5FD_SEC2</tt> driver. The <a
                href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/RM/RM_H5P.html#Property-SetFaplCore"
                    ><tt>H5FD_CORE</tt></a> driver enables an application to work with a file in
            memory. Use the <tt>-Core</tt> switch with the <tt>New-H5Drive</tt> cmdlet to instruct
            PSH5X to use the core driver. The core driver will allocate memory in 64 MB increments.
            Upon <tt>Remove-H5Drive</tt> or closing a session the core file contents will be flushed
            to the file on disk that was specified via <tt>-File</tt> when <tt>New-H5Drive</tt> was
            invoked. </p>
        <p>To use the core driver with the HDF5 sandbox drive, <tt>h5tmp</tt>, set the
                <tt>PSH5XTmpCoreVFD</tt> environment variable (before invoking <tt>Import-Module
                HDF5</tt>).</p>
        <p>You can determine the driver used for a drive by checking the <tt>Driver</tt> property of
            the <tt>PSH5X.DriveInfo</tt> object, i.e.,</p>
        <pre class="code">
PS:1 >Import-Module HDF5
PS:2 >(Get-H5Drive h5tmp).Driver
H5FD_SEC2
        </pre>
        <p>
            <b>Caution:</b> The core VFD is is not a fire-and-forget solution and your mileage may
            vary. </p>
        <h3>Controlling the HDF5 Object Format</h3>
        <p>Newer versions of the HDF5 library support optimized object formats that, for example,
            enable compression on groups or let one create large (&gt; 64K) attributes. They
            dramatically improve performance for certain use cases, but creating such objects in a
            file breaks backward compatibility with older versions of the library, i.e., an older
            version of the library may not be able to read certain objects.</p>
        <p>By default PSH5X creates objects compatible with the earliest possible format for each
            object. This behavior can be overridden (and backward compatibility reduced) via the
                <tt>-V18</tt> or the <tt>-Latest</tt> switches of the <tt>New-H5Drive</tt> cmdlet.
            They correspond to using <tt>H5F_LIBVER_18</tt> or <tt>H5F_LIBVER_LATEST</tt> for the
                <tt>libver_low</tt> argument in <a
                href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/RM/RM_H5P.html#Property-SetLibverBounds"
                    ><tt>H5Pset_libver_bounds</tt></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The HDF5 sandbox drive, <tt>h5tmp</tt>, is created with <tt>H5F_LIBVER_LATEST</tt> for both
            <tt>libver_low</tt> and <tt>libver_high</tt>.
